# Degu
A Python script to count the number of turns that degu had run.


There's a degu in the lab. My professor used a PC with Windows XP to count the number of turns which degu had run.
Therefore, that PC seems had some problem and can't save the data for long time.
So he asked me that if I could build a budget to replace that PC.

I use Python 3 in a Raspberry Pi 3 to solve this problem.
The script will count the turns for 4'59".
